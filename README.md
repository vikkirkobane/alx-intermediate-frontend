### `0-index.html`

This file demonstrates a simple HTML document structure that includes:
    - A `<header>` with navigation links.
    - A `<main>` section containing an `<article>` with a title and content.
    - A `<footer>` with copyright information.

### `1-index.html`

This file enhances the previous HTML document by adding:
    - Meta tags for character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport for improved SEO and accessibility.
    - A title tag for the document.

### `2-index.html`

This file creates a blog post layout using semantic HTML elements, including:
    - A `<header>` with the blog title and navigation.
    - An `<article>` with multiple sections, including an introduction, main content, and conclusion.
    - A footer with author information.

### `3-index.html`

This file enhances form accessibility by implementing ARIA roles and attributes, including:
    - A form with fields for name and email, complete with appropriate labels and ARIA attributes.
    - An alert region for live updates.
